# .NET Reference Source

The referencesource repository contains sources from [Microsoft .NET Reference Source](http://referencesource.microsoft.com/)
that represent a subset of the .NET Framework.  This subset contains similar functionality to the class libraries that are being
developed in [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx).  We intend to consult the referencesource repository as we develop
.NET Core.  It is also for the community to leverage to enable more scenarios for .NET developers. 

Please note that the referencesource repository is read-only.  Questions and pull requests should be done through [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx).
