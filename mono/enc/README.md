* Sample1: Swap a method, and do that twice (i.e. apply multi updates).
* Sample2: Swapped method calls another method that previously existed.
* Sample3: Replaced method references a string that hasn't existed before (user string heap).
* Sample4: Replaced method uses a different class token (blob heap).
* Sample5: Swapped method calls another method that hasn't previously existed (i.e. add a new method, woot!).
