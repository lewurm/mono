mono (3.2.1+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "REJECT FALSE ICONS" release

  [ Jo Shields ]
  * [b9108c7] Dirty patch to introduce a new System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser 
    back-end, which does absolutely nothing. This is to allow applications 
    which create a WebBrowser object to continue to run without crashing, 
    in the absence of a working browser back-end (which we lack right now). 
    This patch is sufficient for 
    http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/CSharp/0460__GUI-Windows-Forms/AsimpleBrowser.htm
    to run without crashing. (Closes: #683289, #694948)
  * [d20f6ad] Update README.source for the latest +dfsg changes
  * [621d62b] Imported Upstream version 3.2.1+dfsg
  * [a469da4] Delete .git folders which are incorrectly supplied (sometimes) 
    in upstream tarballs
  * [93dc83d] Remove IA64 as a build arch, it's abandoned upstream - add 
    newly fixed MIPS (little endian) instead.
  * [45139df] Refresh debian/ - including new split-off packages - now SGen 
    is default
  * [f8f6ae7] Rename libmono-2.0 packages to libmonoboehm-2.0 as appropriate.
  * [22f5059] Add new GAC'd assemblies from this release.
  * [7876094] Refreshed dh_makeclilibs version information to reflect ABI 
    and API bumps.
  * [0916fab] Rename libmono-csharp4.0-cil.install to 
    libmono-csharp4.0a-cil.install, due to heavy ABI breakage.
  * [c4437d1] Fix compilation failure to due to uninitialized variable.
  * [b53dbb2] Create a set of new packages for PCL Facades.
  * [1054a3b] Add Xamarin to copyright file
  * [3643568] Fix compilation failure to due to uninitialized variable.
  * [0873f74] Replace references to Novell in package descriptions with

  [ Atsushi Eno ]
  * [15e60b3] Add Assembly version attributes to hopefully fix bug #10002.
    (cherry picked from commit cd6dc32e0b936645bf2f89e1bf61c6ae04c3258a)
    The new files are modified by this commit but were not present in the
    packaged release.
  * [5b98c36] [rx] Add missing AssemblyInfos.
    (cherry picked from commit 7890e1e824b91b1fd30d375b8cfb19d5abb23c5a)
  * [7cb9532] remove wrong EOLs after Libs: in reactive.pc.in. Third 
    attempt to fix bug #10002.
    (cherry picked from commit 5c228f3dd0e9b32a5b0d4aaaf0903ebaeae5a6d9)
  * [8583276] Fix build (giconv.c) (cherry picked from commit 
    37e7f2fb50e2f357ae4068d3b7551ff411f9f77c)

  [ Carlos Martín Nieto ]
  * [b85c794] Create package for Reactive Extensions.
    Now that they have a version, let's create binary packages for them.

  [ Alex Rønne Petersen ]
  * [172471f] Support a MONO_ARCH_HAVE_TLS_INIT variable.
    Setting this on an architecture makes Mini call
    mono_arch_tls_init () on thread attach.
    This is primarily useful for architectures that have not
    had their LMF code ported to the new infrastructure due to
    a general lack of maintenance or hardware to do it on.
    (cherry picked from commit f87a4f127d1a0ea1cf4145f9605c5698af08c6cf)
  * [7cbea71] MIPS: Set USE_MUL to 0 by default (for now).
    Setting it to 1 breaks on Loongson CPUs which are the most common
    desktop MIPS CPUs supported by e.g. Debian.
    This change can be reverted when more investigation is done to find
    out why exactly this breaks.
    Thanks to Jo Shields (@directhex) for lots of testing and debugging
    and spotting this define that turned out to be the culprit.
    (cherry picked from commit 0e67acba31c39e37b1bc55afb28d157c36895c23)

  [ Jeffrey Stedfast ]
  * [090dda7] [eglib] Fixed g_utf8_to_utf16_general() to handle 
    invalid utf8 (cherry picked from commit 
    a81cd6dae81a7077a7f014948c78075da08f02f7)

  [ Zoltan Varga ]
  * [49af7b0] [sgen] Use __builtin_ctzl () in OBJ_BITMAP_FOREACH_PTR () on 64 
    bit platforms. Fixes #14834. (cherry picked from commit 
    d2cc22580898df5d4a15e0f99ab513e1570a6082)
    Thanks to Andres G. Aragoneses (@knocte) for his help tracking this one
    down, as it broke Banshee.

  * [c934e01] Remove unused File::Basename import from runtime script.
    Having this present causes failures on release upgrades where perl-base
    and perl-modules are not in a consistent state (e.g. this can happen
    when upgrading across major Perl versions). (Closes: #665335) (LP:
    #948848)
  * [9e3cc40] Remove monodoc-base trigger.
    This trigger updated the monodoc search index. It ended up calling
    /usr/bin/monodoc, which is shipped in the monodoc-browser package
    (source package mono-tools). The script attempted to check that
    monodoc-browser was configured, but didn't get this right. This led to
    numerous upgrade failures when Depends of monodoc-browser were not
    satisfied when the trigger was invoked and calling monodoc to update the
    search index bombed out due to this. It's more correct to just have
    monodoc-browser ship this trigger itself. (LP: #972751)
  * [dd2925c] Standards-Version bump to 3.9.3, no changes required
